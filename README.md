# keras-segmentation-sota-models
A keras implementation of many sota segmentation model with different backbones, such as Unet, Bisenet, Linknet

Created by Yuxin Mao, if you have any problem in using it, please contact: maoyuixnssyh@my.swjtu.deu.cn

This version can only be used for binary image segmentation at present, and multi-class segmentation will be updated later.

### To do list
